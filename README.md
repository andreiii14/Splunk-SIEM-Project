## Brute Force Attack Detection <a name="brute-force-attack-detection"></a>

### Purpose

- A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method where attackers systematically attempt various username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access. This method exploits weak or easily guessable credentials, relying on the sheer volume of attempts rather than specific knowledge about the target. Automated tools are utilized for this process. To identify potential brute-force attacks, the provided Splunk query analyzes Windows security logs, highlighting users who have experienced both successful logins and numerous failed attempts. Adjusting thresholds aligns the detection with specific security policies and environment characteristics.

### Steps

**1. Use the provided Splunk query to identify potential brute-force attacks.**

![34 BRUTEFORCE](https://github.com/andreiii14/Splunk-SIEM-Project/assets/128039153/45f66ebf-865f-42bd-a2f6-41e3bb10879d)

**2. Adjust thresholds based on security policies and environment characteristics. (For this example, we used 5 as a threshold)**

### Query

```spl
index=* sourcetype=win*security user=* user!="" 
| stats count(eval(action="success")) as successes count(eval("failure")) as failures by user 
| where successes>0 AND failures>5
```

## Network and Port Scanning <a name="network-and-port-scanning"></a>

### Purpose 

- Scanning is a method employed by attackers to explore available IPs and Ports across a network, revealing potential vulnerabilities for exploitation. While authorized personnel may conduct such activities for vulnerability assessment, it's crucial to be vigilant if unauthorized scanning occurs. The query identifies hosts reaching out to more than 500 IPs or ports rapidly, indicating potential scanning. The presence of a source IP suggests internal origin, signaling a possible infection, warranting prompt incident response.

![31 port scanning](https://github.com/andreiii14/Splunk-SIEM-Project/assets/128039153/4a92178a-688c-4892-a743-4a2e764aa0cb)

### Query

```spl
index=* sourcetype=firewall*
| stats dc(dest_port) as num_dest_port dc(dest_ip) as num_dest_ip by src_ip
| where num_dest_port > 500 OR num_dest_ip > 500
```

## Unencrypted Web Communications <a name="unencrypted-web-communications"></a>

### Purpose

- Secure communication is essential for protecting sensitive data. Unencrypted web communications pose a significant security risk. The query identifies instances of unencrypted communication, offering the flexibility to create dashboards for daily monitoring, generate periodic reports, or set up alerts for immediate notification. This proactive approach helps maintain a secure network environment, ensuring that critical resources are accessed only through encrypted connections.

![32 detecting unecrpted](https://github.com/andreiii14/Splunk-SIEM-Project/assets/128039153/c81a50c3-f562-4fee-86d1-a090727d427b)

### Query

```spl
index=* sourcetype=firewall_data dest_port!=443
| table _time user app bytes* src_ip dest_ip dest_port
```

## Memory Utilization Monitoring <a name="memory-utilization-monitoring"></a>

### Purpose:

- As the system's physical memory depletes, it resorts to storing data on disk, significantly slowing down data retrieval. To prevent performance issues, it's essential to track the memory utilization of OS processes. This is achieved by installing the Splunk add-on, enabling vmstat.sh, and setting up an alert to monitor memory usage. The query, scheduled at intervals, calculates the maximum memory utilization percentage by host. Alerts triggered when this surpasses 80% enable proactive identification of hosts at risk, facilitating timely intervention and system optimization.

### Steps:

1. **Install the [Splunk add-on](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/742).**


2. Ensure **vmstat.sh** is **enabled**.

**3. Set up an alert to monitor memory usage with the provided query.**

![33 memory](https://github.com/andreiii14/Splunk-SIEM-Project/assets/128039153/9993506e-6cb0-4f6e-9b94-44feef31d6d9)

### Query

```spl
index=main sourcetype=vmstat
| stats max(memUsedPct) as memused by host
| where memused > 80
```

## Failed Password Attempts Monitoring <a name="failed-password-attempts-monitoring"></a>

### Purpose
- Monitoring failed passwords is critical for identifying potential security breaches. A surge in failed login attempts indicates unauthorized access attempts. The Splunk query counts failed password attempts, offering insights into potential malicious activities. This information can be transformed into alerts, providing real-time notifications when a threshold of failed attempts is reached. Proactive monitoring of failed passwords strengthens overall cybersecurity, enabling timely responses to potential threats.

### Steps

**1. Create a dashboard that monitors EventCode 4625 in the index chosen.**

![15 - final dashboard](https://github.com/andreiii14/Splunk-SIEM-Project/assets/128039153/e19f3438-abe3-4940-9723-9fbba0b36580)

**2. Highlight important information for easy understanding.**

index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625 host=* host!=""
| stats count(eval(status="Success")) as successes count(eval(status="Failure")) as failures by host
| where successes>0 AND failures>5
```

## Blocked URLs Monitoring <a name="blocked-urls-monitoring"></a>

### Purpose:

- In a secure network environment, it's crucial to control and monitor user access to specific websites for compliance and security reasons. The implementation of a Group Policy Object (GPO) named 'Blocked URLs' on the Domain Controller facilitates the blocking of selected websites, such as Facebook and Instagram. By creating an outbound firewall rule, enforcing the policy, and integrating DNS debug logs into Splunk, administrators gain visibility into users attempting to access blocked URLs. The associated dashboard displays relevant details, empowering administrators to enforce internet usage policies effectively.

### Steps:

1. **Create a New GPO Named 'Blocked URLs'**
   - On the Domain Controller (Host VM), create a new Group Policy Object named 'Blocked URLs.'
